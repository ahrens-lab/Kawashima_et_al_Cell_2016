This is a repository for the analysis algorithms used in Kawashima et al, Cell, 2016.

Folder list

  cell-detection      ->  a Matlab code set for detecting cells expressing nuclear-localized GCaMP

  image-registration  -> a C/CUDA code set for correcting 2D translations of individual Z-plane timeseries.
  
  motion-estimation   -> a Matlab code set for inferring 3-dimensional deformation in the timeseries

Note

  Each code set contains small sample data for testing. Input parameters were optimized for this sample datasets.
